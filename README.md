# SecretGiftGame
Python app to manage a secret gift game.

The purpose of the game is to secretly provide a gift, often of low, limited cost to another, randomly selected player.

Each player provides a wrapped gift. They enter their name in the application and are give a number which they write on the gift then place that gift in the pool.
After all players have added their name and gift, the application will select each player in a random order, assigning them a gift that they have not provided.
Within the game, the first player must open their gift but subsequent players have the option to open their gift or to swap the unopened gift for one that has already been opened, i.e. to steal a previously opened gift. Players do not know what gift they will take home until the last player has made their decision.
